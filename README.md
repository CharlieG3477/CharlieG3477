Hi my name is Charles Germany,


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on graduating from Clemson.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently trying to learn too many things.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with becoming a better programmer.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything but coding.
- âš¡ Fun fact: Three of my favorite things are milk, cheesecake, and software engineering!
